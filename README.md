# omok

## Description

Omok, also known as [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku), is a two-player game where the players take turns placing their stones on a go board. The first player to get five stones in a row wins.

I implemented this game to practice blind omok in [Devil's plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Plan).
